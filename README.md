Please review my case study and code submitted along with it.
My case study is based on sentiment and context analysis and I have used couple of reviews.
First one is from Amazon product reviews and second one is IMDB movie reviews.
In Amazon Analysis I have rendered the wordcloud which contain the import words mentionedby customers and 
IMDB reviews are showing polarity in the texual format.
For IMDB sentiment analysis I have used Deep Learning that BiDirectional LSTM.
